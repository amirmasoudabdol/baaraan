## Introduction

Baaraan (Farsi: باران, [_baran_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/باران), | bârân |) is a collection of missing multivariate random number distributions for Modern C++ with [STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random)-like API. For the start, some of the more important and useful distributions are implemented and tested, e.g., Multivariate Normal Distribution, and I am hopping to slowly expand the list of the distributions, and maybe even add some noise functions to the library later on.

This website is mainly dedicated to baaraan's API, and some examples. If you are used to the STL's random distributions, baaraan should feels very familiar and easy to use. Head to the API section and browse your way to the documentation of different distributions.

## Quick Start

Please visit the main [README](https://github.com/amirmasoudabdol/baaraan) page of the project for a quick installation/start guide.
